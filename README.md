## Project Brocallie
> Currently focusing on Android development. iOS support is coming soon!

The main function of this app is to enable conversational interactions with AI using Generative AI technology.

This project is developed using Compose Multiplatform, aiming for a multi-module structure with a focus on Android's Dynamic Feature Modules (DFM).

The architecture of Google's Now in Android app serves as a key inspiration, and the project is designed with potential expansion to platforms beyond Android and iOS in mind.
